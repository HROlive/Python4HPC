    "Many Unix/Linux systems come preinstalled with python nowadays. However in most systems the installation of new packages requires superuser privileges. Furthermore the version that is provided by the system may not be the one you want or need. If you have multiple projects, depending on different versions of libraries can be even more cumbersome to maintain."

This allows a user to install the exact version of the libraries they want to use without needing any superuser privileges. Especially when you work together on projects or use different machines this is a very valueable tool.\n",

To simplify the usage the `venv` comes with an activation script that sets up the local environment for usage of the `venv`. For this bash's builtin `source` command is used to activate the environment. Consecutive `pip install` commands will install the packages into this local directory. See the example below."

    "**Anaconda** is a software distribution for python and R and provided by Anaconda Inc. \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` itself is actually only the package manager and language-agnostic. `conda` was deemed necessary because there were certain problems with `pip` the default python package installer regarding dependency resolution of packages and security issues. It is mainly used to install matching versions of precompiled scientific libraries for python without going through the trouble of compiling them yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to start with the `Miniconda` installer instead of the full `Anaconda` distribution and download the specific packages that are needed afterwards. There is also another (community) installer named `Miniforge` that has `conda-forge` as main channel per default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is similar to other package managers and offers different repositories for installing packages. In conda these repositories are called `channel`. By default conda installs packages from the `default` channel (which is Anaconda Inc's own channel). \n",

    "A very popular conda channel is also the previously mentioned community driven __[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)__ that hosts more recent versions of many packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` has a highest to lowest channel priority. This means that if a package is found in a higher priority channel (e.g. `default`) and the package satisfies the installation specifications, the packages in the lower priority channels are ignored. If you want to force the install of a version from a lower priority channel you need to use the additional install switch e.g. `--channel conda-forge`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you always want to install the newest version available you can also disable the channel priority via `conda config --set channel_priority false`. For more infos on channels see __[Managing channels](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html#)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` also supports having different environments to manage different installations. However `conda` can do a bit more than the other virtual environments: with conda it is possible to directly install a specific python version for your environment as well as other binary dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "After installing `conda` only the `base` environment is usually available. From there you can create other environments, clone environments, install packages and also export environment settings to a file.\n",

    "At its core VS Code is 'just' a simple open-source code editor. However lots of available extensions support a variety of use cases of this IDE. Code gained immensely in popularity in the past years and has a very active community. It is very well equipped for developing and debugging with many programming languages and is available for free on Windows, Mac & Linux (see __[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)__).\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended way to get started with VS Code & Python Development is to install e.g. the *Python Extension Pack* by Don Jayamanne which already contains a collection of all major extensions you need to give it a go (also see __[Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)__)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many other extensions to check out e.g.: *Remote Development*, *Docker Extension Pack*, *Singularity*, *GitLens* and so on ...\n",
    "\n",
    "With the extensions frome the *Python Extension Pack* VS Code recognizes python, venv, pipenv and even conda installations and lets the user select the right environment. It also possible to run python programs interactively or debug them by using the integrated debugger UI, run scripts and manage code through your VCS. \n",

    "\n",
    "PyCharm is a commercial product from JetBrains and compared to VS Code a ready to go all-in-one solution for python development. It is based on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Platform which was originally conceived for Java Development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes in two major editions: \n",
    "- Community: has all the main features (editor, debugger, refactoring, vcs support) and is free to use as well as open-source\n",
    "- Professional: has additional features for scientific python, web development and specific python frameworks as well as a profiler & remote development\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDE is known for its support and integration of tools as well as its refactoring and smart code navigation capabilities and is also available for Windows, Mac & Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an option for educational/classroom licenses for students and academic staff (see __[Educational Licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education)__) - however please note that it is explicity stated that it may only be used for training purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course PyCharm also comes with its own plugin system and a marketplace - however it is not as extensive as the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially the builtin (professional edition) Scientific mode and the Jupyter notebook support may be interesting because it allows the user to peak interactively into dataframes and also has a special tool for data plots (SciView).\n",

For example does singularity not isolate the systems user ids from the containers user ids. The container usually just runs with the users privileges - in addition the home directory is also automatically mounted into the container instance."
