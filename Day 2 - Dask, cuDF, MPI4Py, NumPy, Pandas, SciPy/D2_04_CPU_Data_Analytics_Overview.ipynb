    "Dask is an open-source Python library for parallel computing. Dask can scale Python code from multi-core local machines to large distributed clusters, without the code having to be altered a great deal. Dask provides a familiar user interface by mirroring the APIs of other libraries in Python, such as pandas and NumPy. It also enables programmers to run custom algorithms in parallel. It does so by creating lazy, delayed objects. These objects hold the \"recipe\" of how to compute a certain task, without actually performing the computation. These objects are saved in memory as task graphs, wich can be visualized to get a better handle on the actual parallelisaton that is taking place. To actually get the desired numerical result, the task graph has to be passed on to a task scheduler which then performs the computation in parallel.\n",
